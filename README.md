# InternAssessment
Finished Code for Intern Assessment

All Softball Questions have been done in both C++ and Kotlin with the following Exception being the Date problem being done only in Kotlin

Algorithm Questions have both been solved using C++, function as well as my class used to create my own objects are stored.

All 4 SQL questions are answered in the same LoveCouchPosts file with each query having the question asked on top of it.

Thank you again for providing me with the assessment, I honestly learned and had fun with the challenge of doing these problems!
